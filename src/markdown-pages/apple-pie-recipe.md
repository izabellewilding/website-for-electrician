intro: "Yep, nothing fancy here. Just a delicious and classic apple pie. What I love about this apple pie recipe is that it holds its shape when you cut into it. No soupy mess and no crumbly crush, just a solid slice you can dig your fork into!

This apple pie stands tall and you can see every apple layer because yes, it has to taste good, but I want it to look good too! And I’m sharing my secrets on how to get a delicious and perfect apple pie."

PASTRY DOUGH:

1. Mix your flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl.

2. Add your COLD and cubed butter and combine with your fingers. You want to smoosh the butter and flour between your fingertips until you’re left with pea-sized lumps of butter.

3. Mix in the ice water. I recommend having a cup of water with ice in it and grab your 1/3 from there, avoiding the ice. You can use your hands or a wooden spoon to combine.

4. Your dough should be fairly crumbling upon first look but if you squeeze your dough in a fist, it should form a solid mass.

5. Split the dough in half and dump each half onto two sheets of plastic wrap. Form both of them into a disk, wrap in the plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours to get that butter nice and cold again.

FOR THE FILLING:

6. Halfway through your dough chilling time, prepare the filling. Fill a large bowl with water and squeeze in half of your lemon. Peal your apples and place them in the water so they don’t brown.

7. Once they’re all pealed, go back and slice them into 1/8 inch apple slices. Place them in a colander over a large bowl and toss with the 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.

8. Let the apples sit for about 30 minutes until you produce 1/4 worth of apple juice in the bowl. Toss them halfway through to make sure all of the apples have a chance to release their juices. When ready, reserve your 1/4 of apple juice for the filling then let the apples continue to macerate in the fridge.

9. While the apples chill, roll out your pie dough on a well-floured surface. For a 9 inch pie pan, roll it out to about 12 inches in diameter. Place it in your pie dish and crimp the edges to your liking.

10. Brush the base and sides of the pie dough with an egg white. Place in the freezer and then roll out the top half of your pie dough. Slice it into strips, transfer to a cookie sheet, and place them back in the fridge to chill.

11. Now work on the filling. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Then mix in the flour and whisk for about 3 minutes. Add the apple juices, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla and whisk together. Bring to a boil for about 1 minute and then simmer for another minute. You should reach a thin caramel consistency.

12. Remove from heat and thoroughly toss it with your sliced apples. Careful as the sauce will be hot but the cold apples will help to cool it down.
    Remove your pie from the freezer and start to fill it. Don’t just dump in the apples. Tightly stack them one-by-one (round edges facing out) so they’re nice and snug with very few gaps. Pour over any remaining sauce.
    Apply a lattice top and place your completed pie in the freezer while you preheat the oven to 425F.

13. Once preheated, take the pie out of the freezer and brush the top with an egg wash (one whole egg + 1 tbsp water). Generously sprinkle with Demerara sugar, sanding sugar, or regular granulated sugar. Place a large rimmed baking sheet on the lower oven rack to catch any juices that may pour out while the pie bakes.
    Bake on the middle rack for 15 minutes at 425F then drop to 350F and bake for 50-60 minutes. Check it every so often to make sure the top doesn’t brown too quickly. If it does, cover it in foil.

14. It’s ready when the center is bubbling and the crust is a deep golden brown. Let it rest at room temperature for about an hour then transfer to the fridge for at least 2 hours to set.

15. Serve at room temperature or warm it up in a 300F oven. Top with ice cream and enjoy!

  Spiced Yoghurt Sauce"
author: "RECIPE BY SALLY WHITE"
duration: "1hr 30min"
quantity: "serves 6"
difficulty: "intermediate"
intro: "This tasty chicken and aubergine curry has plenty of veg, protein,
  and fiber to keep you feeling good. I've started using kala chana
  (brown or black chickpeas) rather than normal chickpeas, they're
  smaller and heartier. You can buy them from Asda but they can be
  difficult to get hold of ready-soaked. If you can't get hold of
  tinned brown chickpeas, you can buy them dried and soak them over
  night."
ingredients:
  - "600g boneless chicken thighs"
  - "350g plain full fat yoghurt"
  - "1 aubergine"
  - "1 white onion"
  - "1 tin of chana (brown chickpeas)"
  - "1 small bunch of corriander"
  - "1 tsp cumin powder"
  - "1 tsp chili powder"
  - "1 tsp garam massala"
  - "1 thumb sized piece of ginger"
  - "4 cloves of garlic"
  - "2 tbsp of oil"
  - "half a tin of tomatoes"
  - "2-3 chilies (depending on spice level)"
